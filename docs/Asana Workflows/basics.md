# Understanding Workflow Basics

:::info
***The following guides cover the basics of creating a workflow for fixed-deadline projects. The guides assume that you are familiar with Asana's basic operations and functions.***
:::

### What is a Workflow?
A workflow outlines a step-by-step process for how tasks should be completed to achieve a specific goal. In Asana, workflows organize and automate project tasks by breaking down complex processes into smaller, manageable steps. Use Asana's built-in automation tools to streamline task management, save time, increase consistency, and improve team collaboration across your projects.

### Your Asana Toolkit
- **Rules:** Automate project actions with rules.
- **Templates:** A ready-to-use project framework.
- **Projects:** Organize tasks, monitor progress, and manage deadlines.
- **Tasks:** Individual work items within a project, its own deadline, assignee, and details.
- **Subtasks:** Break larger tasks into smaller tasks.
- **Custom fields:** Add specific information to tasks and projects, such as priority levels or budgets.
- **Forms:** Collect information from team members or external parties for new tasks or projects.
- **Integrations:** Connect Asana with other applications to centralize communication or with time-tracking tools to monitor productivity.
