# Mapping Out Your Workflow Steps

  1. Look for and click the "+ Create" button on the top left of your screen. Select the second option "Project" from the drop-down menu. A new screen opens with three options, Blank project, Use a template or Import spreadsheet. Select an option and complete the steps to create a project.

  2. Click the “+ Add new” button or press "Tab+Q" on your keyboard to add a task. List your project's tasks in the order they will be completed. Break down larger tasks into smaller associated tasks to see how all the work fits together.

  3. Use the information from Step 1 to help you define the key processes in your project. Specify the steps your tasks move through from beginning to end, including the transition of tasks from one step to the next.

  4. Select the "Workflow" tab then click on the plus sign "Add section." A new section is added to your project. Write the name of your core step in place of the default title "Untitled section" (Figure 1). Add a section for each core step you defined in Step 2 above.

  5. (Optional) Select the "List" tab to display all the sections you added in Step 3. Click on the plus sign "Add field" to create a custom field column (Figure 2).

    6. (Optional) Select the Overview tab then click the "Project description" box.  Write a brief outline of your workflow to help give you an idea of what triggers and actions you'll need to move your tasks through your workflow. You can also use this outline later to create an SOP (Standard Operating Procedure) or how-to guide for your workflow (Figure 3).
