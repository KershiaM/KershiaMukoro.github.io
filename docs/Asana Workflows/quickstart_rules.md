# Quick Start Guide: Creating Rules in Asana

Before we begin, let's go over the building blocks you will use to create rules:

- **Triggers**: Initiate a rule.
- **Actions**: The automated response following a trigger.
- **Conditions**: Specific criteria to determine if an action should be executed.
- **Sections**: Units within a project that group tasks based on stages or types.
- **Due Dates**: Deadlines assigned to tasks. 
- **Assignees**: Team members responsible for completing tasks.
- **Priorities**: Levels of importance assigned to tasks.
- **Custom Fields**: User-defined fields to add extra information to tasks.
- **Integrations**: Connections with other tools or applications.
