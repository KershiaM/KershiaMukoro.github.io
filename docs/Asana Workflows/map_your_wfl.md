# Map Out a Workflow in 5 Simple Steps

:::info
***The following guide assumes you are familiar with Asana's basic operations and functions.***
:::


**Step 1.** Look for and click the "+ Create" button on the top left of your screen and select the second option "Project" from the drop-down menu.
  - A new screen opens with three options, Blank project, Use a template or Import spreadsheet. 
  - Select an option and complete the steps to create a project.

**Step 2.** Click the “+ Add new” button or press "Tab+Q" on your keyboard to add a task. 
      - List all of your project's tasks in the order they will be completed. 
      - Break down larger tasks into smaller associated tasks to see how all the work fits together.

 <p>
**Step 3.** Select the "Workflow" tab then click on the plus sign "Add section." 
      - What processes transition tasks from one section to the next?
      - Use your list of tasks from **Step 2** to define your key sections.
      - Give your section a name in place of the default "Untitled section" (Figure 1). 
      - Add a new section for each key section you identify.&nbsp;

    **Step 5.** (Optional) Select the Overview tab then click the "Project description" box. 
      - What triggers and actions do you want to move tasks through each step of your workflow?
      - Write an outline of your workflow.
      - Use this outline later to create an SOP (Standard Operating Procedure) or how-to guide for your workflow (Figure 3).&nbsp;
