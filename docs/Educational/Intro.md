# Cybersecurity for Beginners

### What is Cybersecurity?
Cyber threats, such as hackers and malware, target computers, networks, and data. Cybersecurity is the technology and processes designed to defend digital information systems from unauthorized access and cyber threats.


### Cybersecurity vs Information Security
You may sometimes hear cybersecurity and information security (InfoSec) used interchangeably, but they have distinct scopes. InfoSec covers all forms of information, digital or physical, and protects information from unauthorized:

- Access
- Use 
- Distribution
- Disruption
- Change 
- Inspection
- Record
- Destruction  

Cybersecurity is a subset of information security focused on protecting digital assets from online threats. Information security protects all forms of information and aims to ensure its privacy, accuracy, and accessibility. 

### Key Concepts: The CIA Triad
The backbone of digital security in any organization begins with three building blocks known as the CIA Triad:  

<img align="float" src={cia} alt="CIA Triad" width="800" hspace="50"/>
 
<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="Confidentiality" label="Confidentiality: Keeping Information Secret" default>
  - Confidentiality asserts only authorized parties can view or access sensitive information and functions. Confidentiality protects sensitive data and systems from unauthorized view and access.  
  - For example, a diary locked in a drawer. Only you have the key to access the drawer and view the content of the diary. Confidentiality ensures only authorized key holders can access sensitive information or systems.
  </TabItem>
  
  <TabItem value="Integrity" label="Integrity: Ensuring Data Accuracy and Trustworthiness">
  - Integrity asserts only authorized people and means can alter, add or remove sensitive information. Integrity protects data from unauthorized or unwanted changes and countermeasures to prevent or reverse those changes must be implmented.
  - For example, a scoreboard at a sports game. The official scorer ensures the scores are accurate and remain unchanged by anyone else. Integrity ensures that data remains accurate and unaltered, except by authorized users. 
  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="Availability" label="Availability: Reliable Access to Information">
  - Availability asserts systems, functions, and data must be available and accessible on-demand by authorized parties. Measures to quickly restore access must be in place.
  - For example, a public library where books are available for anyone to borrow during opening hours. Availability in cybersecurity ensures information and resources are accessible to authorized users whenever they need them.

### How Does the CIA Triad Relate to Cybersecurity?
The CIA Triad provides a framework for security professionals to address specific issues safeguarding digital assets. Security experts use this framework to guide the development of security policies and shape strategies to combat ever-evolving cyber threats.

- **Confidentiality and Password Protection:** A personal journal locked in a drawer to prevent others from reading your secrets. Confidentiality involves using strong passwords and encryption to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive information. Authorized individuals with the correct 'key' or password can access protected data. Private data, such as financial records or personal emails, remain confidential and only accessible by authorized individuals.  

- **Integrity and Digital Signatures:** A sealed letter sent through the mail. You know if someone tampered with the letter, if the seal is broken on arrival. Integrity uses mechanisms like digital signatures, to verify information has not been altered from its original form. This is crucial for legal documents, medical records, and financial transactions, where authenticity of the data is important. 

- **Availability and Cloud Storage:** A public water fountain that is always available when you need to quench your thirst. Similarly, availability in cybersecurity ensures that data and systems are always accessible to authorized users. Like cloud storage services, such as Google Drive, where you can access files from anywhere, at any time. Businesses and services rely on continuous uptime to serve their customers and for individuals who need access to their information without interruption.
