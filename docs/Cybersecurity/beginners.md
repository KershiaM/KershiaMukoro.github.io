# Cybersecurity Basics for Beginners
Every day, we engage with digital platforms and produce vast amounts of data. From personalized marketing to advancements in healthcare, data holds immense value in today's digital world. We often hear about data breaches exposing the details of millions of consumers. On March 30, 2024, AT&T admitted to a data breach that exposed the sensitive data of 73 million customers. Cybersecurity protects our data and information from cybercriminals and attacks.

Whether you are concerned about protecting your personal data, securing your online transactions, or simply curious about how digital defense mechanisms work, this guide will walk you through the essentials of cybersecurity. 

### What is Cybersecurity?
Cyber threats, such as hackers, malware, and cyber espionage target computers, networks, and data. Cybersecurity uses technology and processes to defend computers, networks, and data from unauthorized access and cyber threats.


### What's the Difference Between Cybersecurity and Information Security?
You may sometimes hear cybersecurity and information security (Infosec) used interchangeably, but they have distinct scopes. Infosec covers all forms of information, digital or physical. 

Infosec protects information from unauthorized:

- Access
- Use 
- Distribution
- Disruption
- Change 
- Inspection
- Record
- Destruction  

Ultimately, cybersecurity can be seen as a subset of information security. Cybersecurity focuses on digital threats to information technology assets. Information security covers the protection of information in all forms and aims to ensure its privacy, accuracy, and accessibility. 

## Key Concepts of the CIA Triad
The backbone of digital security in any organization begins with three building blocks: Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability (CIA).
