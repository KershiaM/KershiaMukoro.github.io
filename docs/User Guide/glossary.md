**Accessibility:** The practice of making your websites usable by as many people as possible, often focusing on individuals with disabilities, but also benefiting a broader user base.

**Aggressive Scan:** An intensive scan that combines multiple features like version detection, OS detection, script scanning, and traceroute to provide a comprehensive view of the target's security profile.

**Command-line Interface (CLI):** A text-based interface used for entering commands directly to a software application.

**Datagrams:** Independent packets of data sent over a network without requiring an established connection, which allows for fast but unreliable data transfer. Each datagram contains its own addressing information.

**Domain:** A domain refers to a group of computers and devices that are managed as a unit with common rules and procedures. Within the Internet, domains are defined by their domain name and have a tree-like structure under the Domain Name System (DNS).

**Domain Name:** An identification string that defines a realm of administrative autonomy, authority, or control within the Internet.

**Domain Name System (DNS):** The system by which Internet domain names and addresses are tracked and regulated. Memorizable domain names are converted to the numerical IP addresses needed for locating computer services and devices.

**Firewall:** A network security system that monitors and controls incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predetermined security rules.

**Graphical User Interface (GUI):** A type of user interface that allows users to interact with electronic devices using graphical icons and visual indicators, instead of just text-based interfaces, typed command labels, or text navigation.

**Hops:** The number of intermediate devices, like routers, that a data packet passes through from its source to its destination. Each hop represents one step in the journey of the packet across the network.

**Host:** Any device that connects to a computer network, capable of sending or receiving data, performing services, and communicating with other network devices.

**IP Address:** A unique string of numbers separated by periods or colons that identifies each computer using the Internet Protocol to communicate over a network.

**IP Address (Blacklisted):** An IP address that has been denied access or flagged on a network due to suspicious or malicious activity. Blacklisting helps in protecting networks by blocking potentially harmful traffic from known bad sources.

**IP (Internet Protocol):** The principal communications protocol in the Internet protocol suite for relaying datagrams across network boundaries, essential for connectivity and the functioning of the Internet.

**Internet Protocol Suite:** A set of communications protocols used for the Internet and similar networks, often referred to as TCP/IP, which includes protocols for routing network traffic, addressing hosts, and ensuring data can be transmitted reliably.

**IP Layer:** The part of the network that is responsible for sending data packets from one device to another across different networks, using IP addresses to identify devices.

**IPv4/IPv6 (Internet Protocol version 4/version 6):** Versions of the internet protocol, with IPv4 using a 32-bit address scheme and IPv6 using a 128-bit address scheme to support more devices.

**Intrusion Detection System (IDS):** Software or devices that monitor networks or systems for malicious activities or policy violations, typically reporting to an administrator or a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system.

**IT Infrastructure:** The combination of hardware, software, network resources, and services required for the operation, management, and monitoring of an enterprise IT environment. This includes physical devices and facilities, data storage solutions, network systems, and software applications.

**Latency:** The delay before a transfer of data begins following an instruction for its transfer, critical in activities requiring real-time responses.

**Lua:** A lightweight, high-level programming language used within NSE (Nmap Scripting Engine) to modify existing scripts or create custom scripts.

**NSE (Nmap Scripting Engine):** An advanced feature of Nmap that allows for the automation of a wide range of networking tasks, including vulnerability scans.

**Network Traffic:** The amount of data moving across a network at a given time. Monitored for performance measurement, network management, and security monitoring.

**OS Detection:** The process of determining the operating system of a host, utilized by Nmap to provide detailed security insights.

**Packet:** A small segment of data sent over a computer network.

**Parsability:** Refers to how easily a computer can understand and process text, code, or data based on set rules. If something is highly parsable, it means it is easy for a computer to read and use.

**Penetration Testing (Pen Testing):** A security exercise where a cybersecurity expert actively tries to exploit vulnerabilities in a computer system, network, or web application. The purpose is to identify security weaknesses and test the effectiveness of existing security measures. Penetration testers use various methods and tools to simulate real-world attacks under controlled conditions, helping organizations strengthen their defenses against potential cyber threats.

**Ping Scan:** A method used by Nmap to determine which hosts are online on a network without performing a full port scan.

**Port:** A virtual data connection used by programs and services to exchange information, identified by specific numbers.

**Ports (Open):** Network ports that are open and accepting connections, potentially exploitable if not properly secured.

**Ports (Closed):** Network ports that reject incoming packets. Closed ports respond to inquiries but do not allow communication through, indicating no active service is listening at that port.

**Port Scan:** A network scan that identifies which ports on a host are open and potentially vulnerable to security breaches.

**Raw Packet Capabilities:** The ability to craft and manipulate packets at the IP layer, enabling detailed network traffic analysis.

**Routing Issues:** Problems that occur in the network layer responsible for directing data packets from a source to a destination. Routing issues can lead to data loss, delays, or data sent over less optimal paths.

**Script Scan:** Uses predefined scripts to perform advanced network discovery and security auditing through Nmap's Scripting Engine (NSE).

**Security Information and Event Management (SIEM):** A set of tools and services offering a holistic view of an organizationâ€™s information security.

**Services:** Programs or processes that run on devices within a network and communicate over it.

**Stealth Scan:** A type of scan that attempts to interact with a host in a way that minimizes the chances of discovery by intrusion detection systems.

**Sudo:** A command in UNIX and Linux operating systems that allows a permitted user to execute a command as the superuser or another user, as specified by the security policy.

**Subnet:** A logically visible section of a larger network, created by dividing it into smaller, manageable pieces. Subnetting is the practice of dividing a network into two or more networks. Subnets help organize network traffic and improve security by reducing the area over which data is broadcast.

**Subnet Mask:** A 32-bit number that masks an IP address and divides the IP address into network and host address segments.

**Traceroute:** A network diagnostic tool integrated into Nmap that traces the path packets take from the host to the target, identifying all the hops along the way.

**Transmission Control Protocol (TCP):** A core protocol of the Internet Protocol Suite that enables reliable, ordered, and error-checked delivery of data between applications running on hosts communicating via an IP network.

**Target:** In the context of Nmap, a target refers to a specific device, system, or network selected for scanning and evaluation purposes.

**Unauthorized Activity:** Any action on a network or system that does not have official approval or violates security policies. This may include accessing restricted files, transmitting sensitive data, or exploiting system vulnerabilities.

**User Datagram Protocol (UDP):** A communications protocol used for establishing low-latency and loss-tolerating connections between applications on the internet.

**Verbosity:** A setting or option in many programs, like Nmap, that allows the user to increase the amount of detail provided in the output of a command or process. Higher verbosity levels provide more detailed diagnostic information.

**Version Detection:** A feature in Nmap that allows the user to determine the version of the service running on an open port.

**Vulnerability Scan:** A process that uses scripts to identify security weaknesses in network devices or applications.
