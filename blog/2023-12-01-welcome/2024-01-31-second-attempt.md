Our latest attempt to conquer Pikes Peak on November 10, 2023, faced us with freezing temperatures and knee-deep snow, ultimately leading to an unsuccessful climb. The challenge became apparent when my friend suffered from severe altitude sickness, making him extremely fatigued. We were just 2 miles from the summit, well past the A-frame shelter, but the effort needed to wade through the snow and his worsening condition forced us to slow down considerably.

Our initial plan was to celebrate reaching the summit by taking the Cog Railway back down, a convenient option for hikers. Unlike my friend, altitude sickness never affects me, which put us in a difficult position when deciding our next steps. We had two choices:

The first option was to give my extra base layers to my friend, push to the summit myself, and then catch the train down, leaving him to possibly make it to the top on his own or call for rescue services. This would require me to drive up Pikes Peak Highway, a 2-3 hour journey in the snow, to pick him up. The thought of leaving him alone, especially underprepared in terms of clothing and facing potential hypothermia or frostbite, filled me with dread.

The second option, and the one we chose, was to turn back. This meant retracing our steps, resulting in a round-trip hike totaling over 20 miles, compared to the approximately 13 miles one-way trip if we could have made it to the summit and taken the Cog Railway back down. This decision highlighted a crucial mistake on my part. Used to feeling warm from physical exertion, I quickly became cold once we stopped moving. We halted not only for my friend's condition but also to allow me to use my cellphone to contact Search and Rescue to inform them of our predicament and to check on the status of Pikes Peak Highway—which turned out to be closed—we had no choice but to proceed on foot. Removing my gloves to use my phone meant my hands got cold very fast, and I struggled to get my gloves back on. I eventually ended up with frost nip on my thumb, a painful reminder of the importance of accessible warmth.

The journey back was taxing. I momentarily lost sight of my friend in the snow, anxiety set in with the realization that our descent was taking far longer than expected. However, the sight of Barr Camp's entrance was a beacon of relief. As we arrived at Barr Camp, we were greeted by the caretakers and five other hikers who were planning to stay overnight before embarking on their Pikes Peak summit attempt the next day. Our arrival happened to coincide with one of the hiker's birthdays. Enveloped in the cabin's warmth, sipping hot chamomile tea and hot chocolate, we shared laughter, sang Happy Birthday, and enjoyed a slice of birthday cake. This unexpected gathering of fellow adventurers added a sense of camaraderie and warmth to our otherwise chilly journey.

This ordeal taught us the vital lesson of being thoroughly prepared. My heavy pack, always stocked with food, tools, and extra battery packs, proved its worth. After an hour of warming up, we resumed our trek back to Barr Trail parking, navigating the snow with our phones and lights fully charged. Despite the challenges, we safely reached our car, a testament to our resilience and preparation.

Covering a distance of 21.31 miles in 12 hours and 7 minutes, this journey was a stark reminder of the unpredictable nature of mountain hiking and the critical importance of preparation, especially in adverse conditions.

### Icy Insights and Frozen Wisdom

1. **The Unpredictability of Altitude Sickness:** We realized that altitude sickness can strike even experienced hikers unexpectedly. Understanding its symptoms and being prepared to respond appropriately is essential.

3. **The Value of Preparation:** This hike underscored the significance of meticulous preparation, not just in terms of gear but also in understanding the route, potential challenges, and having a clear plan for emergencies.

4. **Handling Cold Weather:** The experience of getting cold and struggling to put my gloves back on taught us the importance of easy access to warm clothing and gloves during cold weather hikes.

5. **The Kindness of Fellow Hikers:** Meeting fellow hikers at Barr Camp and sharing a birthday celebration with them reminded us of the strong sense of community among outdoor enthusiasts. Their camaraderie and generosity provided much-needed warmth and encouragement.

6. **Resilience and Determination:** The decision to turn back and face a much longer hike in challenging conditions tested our resilience and determination. It reinforced our commitment to safety and making responsible choices.

Overall, our Pikes Peak adventure taught us that even in the face of adversity, preparation, companionship, and a positive mindset can make a significant difference in ensuring a safe and memorable outdoor experience.
