The series begins by introducing COPD\'s global health impact and its primary symptoms. It then examines the pathophysiological changes occurring in the lungs, detailing the cellular and molecular mechanisms that exacerbate the disease. Subsequent sections analyze the genetic components, discussing how genetic variability influences susceptibility and the impact of familial genetic markers. The article also investigates environmental triggers, such as tobacco smoke, air pollution, occupational hazards, and their roles in the progression and exacerbation of COPD. It concludes by synthesizing these insights, highlighting the multifactorial nature of COPD and the need for further research to unravel its complex genetic and environmental interactions.","slug":"/category/exploring-the-complex-eitology-of-copd","permalink":"/KershiaMukoro.github.io/docs/category/exploring-the-complex-eitology-of-copd","navigation":{"previous":{"title":"Biomarkers as Beacons of Health and Disease","permalink":"/KershiaMukoro.github.io/docs/Life Sciences - Biomarkers/Biomarkers/"},"next":{"title":"The Global Landscape of COPD","permalink":"/KershiaMukoro.github.io/docs/Life Sciences - Biomarkers/COPD/copd1"}}}')}}]);
