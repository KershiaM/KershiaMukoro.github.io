This is especially crucial when attempting a challenging summit like Pikes Peak. Prioritize safety by preparing mentally and physically, staying hydrated, and learning emergency procedures to significantly reduce risks on challenging hikes like Pikes Peak.\\r\\n\\r\\n<Tabs>\\r\\n  <TabItem value=\\"Gear and Clothing Essentials\\" label=\\"Gear and Clothing Essentials\\" default>\\r\\n    - **Sturdy Hiking Boots:** Comfortable and supportive footwear with good traction.\\r\\n    - **Layers of Clothing:** Dress in moisture-wicking base layers, insulating layers, and a waterproof and windproof outer layer to adapt to changing weather conditions.\\r\\n    - **Backpack:** A comfortable backpack to carry essentials, with adjustable straps and padding.\\r\\n    - **Trekking Poles:** Optional but helpful for stability and reducing strain on your knees.\\r\\n    - **Hat and Sunglasses:** To protect from sun exposure at higher altitudes.\\r\\n    - **Gloves:** Warm and waterproof gloves to keep your hands protected.\\r\\n\\r\\n  </TabItem>\\r\\n  <TabItem value=\\"Navigation and Safety Essentials\\" label=\\"Navigation and Safety Essentials\\">\\r\\n    - **AllTrails App:** Download the [AllTrails](https://www.alltrails.com/mobile) app for real-time trail maps, GPS tracking, and trail details.\\r\\n    - **GPS Device:** Optional but useful for tracking your progress.\\r\\n    - **First Aid Kit:** A comprehensive kit with bandages, antiseptic wipes, pain relievers, and essential medical supplies.\\r\\n    - **Emergency Whistle:** A whistle to signal for help in emergencies.\\r\\n    - **Headlamp or Flashlight:** With extra batteries for low-light or nighttime situations.\\r\\n    - **Sunscreen and Lip Balm:** To protect your skin from UV rays and dryness.\\r\\n    - **Personal Locator Beacon (PLB):** Optional but recommended for remote areas.\\r\\n\\r\\n  </TabItem>\\r\\n  <TabItem value=\\"Food and Hydration Essentials\\" label=\\"Food and Hydration Essentials\\">\\r\\n    - **Water and Water Treatment:** Carry plenty of water and a water purification method to refill from natural sources if needed.\\r\\n    - **Energy Snacks:** High-energy snacks like energy bars, trail mix, and dried fruits.\\r\\n    - **Meals:** Lightweight, dehydrated meals or packed meals for sustenance.\\r\\n    - **Cooking Gear:** If planning to cook, a portable stove and cookware for meal preparation.\\r\\n  </TabItem>\\r\\n</Tabs>  \\r\\n\\r\\nAdditionally, attempting a couple of practice runs can be a wise strategy. These practice hikes will allow you to gauge your fitness level, acclimate your body to similar conditions, and refine your hiking strategy before tackling the full ascent of Pikes Peak. For those interested, I have documented these practice runs with photos from my Garmin watch, which you can check out. These images provide a glimpse into the physical and mental preparation involved in such hikes. By familiarizing yourself with the terrain and testing your endurance, you can better prepare for the demands of the hike. Educate yourself about potential hazards and how to mitigate them to ensure a safe adventure. Always put safety first in any hiking endeavor.\\r\\n&nbsp;  \\r\\n<p>\\r\\n  <img src={practicerun} alt=\\"August Run\\" style={{width: 300}} hspace=\\"10\\" />\\r\\n  <img src={practicerun3} alt=\\"september Run\\" style={{width: 294}} hspace=\\"10\\" />\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<br clear=\\"both\\"/>\\r\\n\\r\\n### Altitude Sickness\\r\\nOne of the most common hazards hikers face on Pikes Peak is altitude sickness. As you ascend to higher altitudes, the air becomes thinner and oxygen levels decrease, which can lead to symptoms such as headaches, nausea, and dizziness. It is important to be aware of these symptoms and take necessary breaks or descend if needed.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Rapid Temperature Changes\\r\\nRapid temperature changes present another hazard to keep in mind. On Pikes Peak, the climate can shift swiftly, causing temperatures to drop as much as four degrees for every 1,000 feet you climb. This drop can pose risks to hikers who haven\'t prepared with the right clothing and gear. Packing warm layers and staying informed about the weather forecast are key steps before embarking on your hike. Be aware that hypothermia can occur even in temperatures as high as the mid-50s, while heat exhaustion and heat stroke also pose risks in warmer conditions.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow that we have covered preparation, let\'s dive into my own adventures hiking Pikes Peak!\\r\\n\\r\\n## My Experience Hiking Pikes Peak\\r\\n\\r\\n### Challenges Faced and How I Overcame Them\\r\\nMy hike up Pikes Peak came with its fair share of challenges. On my first attempt, warm temperatures hit 79 degrees Fahrenheit, leading my companion to run out of water halfway. This incident underscored the crucial need for proper hydration and reminded us of the mountain\'s unpredictable weather. Despite this setback, we managed to reach Barr Camp to refill our water and press on.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn November 2023, the challenges intensified. A friend suffered severe altitude sickness and couldn\'t continue past the A-frame shelter. Initially planning to descend via the Cog Railway, his condition forced us to choose between continuing alone or turning back to hike an extra 7 miles. Prioritizing safety over convenience, we opted to return on foot. This decision was complicated as darkness fell and the cold set in, revealing my underestimation of how quickly my body would cool. I had to contact Search and Rescue, hindered by my gloves making it hard to use my phone.\\r\\n\\r\\nDespite these obstacles, we made it back to Barr Camp, greeted by warmth and a chance to recover by the fire. This journey taught me valuable lessons about preparation, the necessity of accessible warm clothing, and the importance of understanding both my own and my companions\' limits before starting an outdoor adventure.\\r\\n\\r\\n### The Importance of Being Prepared\\r\\nMy journey up Pikes Peak underscored the critical role of preparation for any hike. Ensuring you have sufficient water and snacks, the right gear and clothing, and a well-understood route can make or break your hiking experience.\\r\\n\\r\\nA lifesaver in my pack is my life straw, a compact and light filter that lets me safely drink from any water source. This tool has prevented dehydration on several occasions, proving indispensable for outdoor activities.\\r\\n\\r\\nPlanning your route in advance is also key. This means familiarizing yourself with the trail\'s length, elevation gain, possible weather scenarios, and locations of emergency exits or shelters.\\r\\n\\r\\nUnderstanding your physical limits and those of your hiking partners is another essential aspect of preparation. Conditions like altitude sickness and fatigue can significantly affect your hike, so it\'s important to consider these risks beforehand.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn essence, thorough preparation is vital for a safe and enjoyable hike. It not only safeguards your health but could also be crucial in aiding fellow hikers. Therefore, always review your gear, pack ample water and snacks, and study your trail before setting off on any outdoor adventure. Remember, being ready for the unexpected can dramatically enhance your hiking experience.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Happy Hiking!\\r\\nHiking Pikes Peak is an incredible experience and remains one of my most cherished adventures. The breathtaking views, challenging terrain, and sense of accomplishment upon reaching the summit make every step worthwhile. From the Barr Trail to the summit, every step offers its own unique challenges and rewards. With proper preparation, determination, and a passion for adventure, anyone can conquer this iconic mountain. But don\'t just take my word for it, lace up your hiking boots and go experience it for yourself! For a more detailed account of each trip, make sure to check out my other blog posts.

The challenge became apparent when my friend suffered from severe altitude sickness, making him extremely fatigued. We were just 2 miles from the summit, well past the A-frame shelter, but the effort needed to wade through the snow and his worsening condition forced us to slow down considerably.\\r\\n\\r\\nOur initial plan was to celebrate reaching the summit by taking the Cog Railway back down, a convenient option for hikers. Unlike my friend, altitude sickness never affects me, which put us in a difficult position when deciding our next steps. We had two choices:\\r\\n\\r\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first option was to give my extra base layers to my friend, push to the summit myself, and then catch the train down, leaving him to possibly make it to the top on his own or call for rescue services. This would require me to drive up Pikes Peak Highway, a 2-3 hour journey in the snow, to pick him up. The thought of leaving him alone, especially underprepared in terms of clothing and facing potential hypothermia or frostbite, filled me with dread.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe second option, and the one we chose, was to turn back. This meant retracing our steps, resulting in a round-trip hike totaling over 20 miles, compared to the approximately 13 miles one-way trip if we could have made it to the summit and taken the Cog Railway back down. This decision highlighted a crucial mistake on my part. Used to feeling warm from physical exertion, I quickly became cold once we stopped moving. We halted not only for my friend\'s condition but also to allow me to use my cellphone to contact Search and Rescue to inform them of our predicament and to check on the status of Pikes Peak Highway\u2014which turned out to be closed\u2014we had no choice but to proceed on foot. Removing my gloves to use my phone meant my hands got cold very fast, and I struggled to get my gloves back on. I eventually ended up with frost nip on my thumb, a painful reminder of the importance of accessible warmth.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe journey back was taxing. I momentarily lost sight of my friend in the snow, anxiety set in with the realization that our descent was taking far longer than expected. However, the sight of Barr Camp\'s entrance was a beacon of relief. As we arrived at Barr Camp, we were greeted by the caretakers and five other hikers who were planning to stay overnight before embarking on their Pikes Peak summit attempt the next day. Our arrival happened to coincide with one of the hiker\'s birthdays. Enveloped in the cabin\'s warmth, sipping hot chamomile tea and hot chocolate, we shared laughter, sang Happy Birthday, and enjoyed a slice of birthday cake. This unexpected gathering of fellow adventurers added a sense of camaraderie and warmth to our otherwise chilly journey.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis ordeal taught us the vital lesson of being thoroughly prepared. My heavy pack, always stocked with food, tools, and extra battery packs, proved its worth. After an hour of warming up, we resumed our trek back to Barr Trail parking, navigating the snow with our phones and lights fully charged. Despite the challenges, we safely reached our car, a testament to our resilience and preparation.\\r\\n\\r\\nCovering a distance of 21.31 miles in 12 hours and 7 minutes, this journey was a stark reminder of the unpredictable nature of mountain hiking and the critical importance of preparation, especially in adverse conditions.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Icy Insights and Frozen Wisdom\\r\\n\\r\\n1. **The Unpredictability of Altitude Sickness:** We realized that altitude sickness can strike even experienced hikers unexpectedly. Understanding its symptoms and being prepared to respond appropriately is essential.\\r\\n\\r\\n2. **The Importance of Staying Together:** The decision to stay together, even when facing a difficult situation, reinforced the importance of companionship and mutual support in the wilderness.\\r\\n\\r\\n3. **The Value of Preparation:** This hike underscored the significance of meticulous preparation, not just in terms of gear but also in understanding the route, potential challenges, and having a clear plan for emergencies.\\r\\n\\r\\n4. **Handling Cold Weather:** The experience of getting cold and struggling to put my gloves back on taught us the importance of easy access to warm clothing and gloves during cold weather hikes.\\r\\n\\r\\n5. **The Kindness of Fellow Hikers:** Meeting fellow hikers at Barr Camp and sharing a birthday celebration with them reminded us of the strong sense of community among outdoor enthusiasts. Their camaraderie and generosity provided much-needed warmth and encouragement.\\r\\n\\r\\n6. **Resilience and Determination:** The decision to turn back and face a much longer hike in challenging conditions tested our resilience and determination. It reinforced our commitment to safety and making responsible choices.\\r\\n\\r\\nOverall, our Pikes Peak adventure taught us that even in the face of adversity, preparation, companionship, and a positive mindset can make a significant difference in ensuring a safe and memorable outdoor experience."},{"id":"/2023/12/04/2023-12-01-welcome/first-attempt","metadata":{"permalink":"/KershiaMukoro.github.io/blog/2023/12/04/2023-12-01-welcome/first-attempt","source":"@site/blog/2023-12-01-welcome/2023-12-04-first-attempt.md","title":"Pikes Peak Adventure: Lessons Learned from Running Out of Water","description":"On a sunny September 19, 2019, my boots hit the Barr Trail, eager for the ascent of Pikes Peak.

Yet, the mountain had its tests in store, starting with an unexpected blast of 79-degree heat that soon put our preparation to the test.\\r\\n\\r\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\r\\n\\r\\nThe hike began under a clear blue sky at 08:56 AM. Right from the start, Pikes Peak offered a mix of welcoming and warning signs \u2014 a playful hint at the challenge ahead. Despite the conflicting mileage on the signs, we ventured into the heart of the trail, greeted by its infamous switchbacks. These early twists and turns, leading to the Incline Access point, were a true test of our resolve, especially after my encounters with other Colorado giants.\\r\\n\\r\\nLeaving the Access point behind, the trail unveiled its wonders: arch-like rock formations and the serene No Name Creek. Yet, it was Lightning Point that truly took our breath away, offering a distant glimpse of our summit goal. However, the lure of the view couldn\'t keep us for long, with Barr Camp beckoning just a mile ahead.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was at this juncture that my companion revealed his empty water bottle, a silent testament to the day\'s heat. Without hesitation, I shared my spare, a small act of camaraderie on this towering adventure. Barr Camp, though welcoming, reminded us of the wilderness\'s rules: no drinking water. Thankfully, my trusty life straw turned the mountain stream into a lifesaving oasis.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith replenished bottles, we pressed on, the trail winding northward and upward through more switchbacks, past the Bottomless Pit Trail junction, and finally breaking free from the tree line near the Timberline A-frame shelter. This rustic refuge, offering water from a nearby creek, was a welcome sight on our descent.\\r\\n\\r\\nBeyond the shelter, the world transformed into an alpine wonderland, with the Roberts Memorial marking our progress. The Golden Stairs loomed ahead, a series of short switchbacks leading us tantalizingly close to our goal. With each step, the summit drew nearer, until at last, the vast expanse of the summit plateau unfolded before us.\\r\\n\\r\\nStanding atop Pikes Peak, the journey\'s trials faded into the background, overshadowed by the sheer majesty of the views. After soaking in the scenery and capturing memories through our lenses, we began our descent, spirits high and water bottles full, courtesy of the Summit House.\\r\\n\\r\\nOur adventure concluded just shy of 9 hours, a testament to the mountain\'s challenge and our determination. This journey was more than a hike; it underscored the beauty of nature, the critical role of being well-prepared, and the strength of camaraderie through challenging times.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Lessons Learned from Our Pikes Peak Adventure\\r\\n\\r\\nOur adventure up Pikes Peak taught us invaluable lessons that extend far beyond the trail. Here are the key takeaways from our journey:\\r\\n\\r\\n1. **Preparation is Key**: Carrying enough water, snacks, and the right gear can make a significant difference in your hiking experience. Always anticipate the unexpected and plan accordingly.\\r\\n\\r\\n2. **The Value of Teamwork**: Sharing resources and supporting each other in times of need not only strengthens bonds but can also be a lifesaver. The act of sharing a spare water bottle was a simple yet profound gesture of camaraderie.\\r\\n\\r\\n3. **Adaptability and Resilience**: Facing the unpredictability of weather and physical challenges, we learned the importance of being adaptable and resilient. Knowing when to press on and when to turn back is crucial for mountain safety.\\r\\n\\r\\n4. **The Lifesaving Simplicity of a Life Straw**: This experience highlighted the importance of having a reliable method to purify water directly from natural sources, demonstrating that sometimes the simplest tools can be the most essential.\\r\\n\\r\\n5. **Personal Limits and Safety**: Understanding and respecting our own limits and those of our companions is vital. Safety should always come first, even if it means altering your plans.\\r\\n\\r\\n6. **The Joy of the Journey**: Despite the challenges, the sense of accomplishment and the stunning beauty of Pikes Peak made every step worth it. The journey itself is as rewarding as reaching the destination.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThese lessons will accompany us on all future adventures, reminding us of the importance of preparation, teamwork, and respect for nature\'s unpredictability."},{"id":"/blog","metadata":{"permalink":"/KershiaMukoro.github.io/blog/blog","source":"@site/blog/2023-12-01-welcome/2023-12-01-index.md","title":"Welcome","description":"Welcome to my blog Wandering the Wilds!","date":"2023-12-01T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[],"readingTime":0.705,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[],"frontMatter":{"title":"Welcome","slug":"/blog","name":"Kershia Mukoro"},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Pikes Peak Adventure: Lessons Learned from Running Out of Water","permalink":"/KershiaMukoro.github.io/blog/2023/12/04/2023-12-01-welcome/first-attempt"}},"content":"import collage from \'../../static/img/collage.png\';\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n### Welcome to my blog Wandering the Wilds!\\r\\n\\r\\nI\'m Kershia, a tech enthusiast, a soldier in the Army Reserves, and a medical lab specialist.
