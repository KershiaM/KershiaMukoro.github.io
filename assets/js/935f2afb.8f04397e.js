This condition, which includes chronic bronchitis and emphysema, poses a marked socioeconomic burden globally. The DALY rates (Figure 1), a measure of the disease\'s impact on quality of life, provided by the Global Burden of Disease study, shows a clear depiction of COPD\'s uneven distribution. For instance, regions like South Asia experience a greater-than-expected impact of COPD relative to their development level, suggesting a disproportionate burden of the disease in these areas (Figure 2).","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"Life Sciences - COPD/copd2":{"id":"Life Sciences - COPD/copd2","title":"Decoding COPD From Symptoms to Molecular Mechanisms","description":"Pathophysiology of COPD","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"Life Sciences - COPD/copd3":{"id":"Life Sciences - COPD/copd3","title":"Unraveling the Complex Genetic Landscape of COPD","description":"Introduction to Genetic Influences","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"Life Sciences - COPD/copd4":{"id":"Life Sciences - COPD/copd4","title":"Environmental Triggers and COPD","description":"Complex Environmental Influences on COPD","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"Life Sciences - COPD/copd5":{"id":"Life Sciences - COPD/copd5","title":"A Multidimensional Approach to COPD","description":"The multifaceted nature of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) defies simple explanations.
