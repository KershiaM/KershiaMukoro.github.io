Alleles such as Z and S lead to reduced levels of this protective enzyme, contributing to the development of COPD, particularly in individuals with the ZZ genotype. This genotype predisposes individuals to early onset emphysema and a higher COPD risk, which is illustrated by the genotype-specific decline in plasma levels of alpha-1 antitrypsin (Figure 1).
